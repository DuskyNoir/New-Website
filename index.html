                        and also beginner skills for entering the industry. They also provide information that can allow children to make 
                        money right after learning their skills, allowing them to gain more experience and build up a portfolio within weeks. 
                        They offer a wide range of opportunities such as video editing, web development, stocks and mobile development.

                    To further incentivize children to learn, they offer certificates, treating their website as sort of a class session. 
                    Through each course you try to complete there will be many videos, many quizes and an assignment that 
                    requires you to use the skills you learned. For instance: if I take the web development course I will be tested 
                    upon my knoledge of html, website security and job knowledge and will be tasked with making a good website 
                    at the end.  In fact that is the situation I am in right now. Also, at the end of each day, students are required to 
                    summarize what they learned that day.
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    Each class once completed gives you a certain amount of credits, when you reach 20 credits you can graduate 
                    from the program, and if you achieve 25 credits you graduate with honors. This certificate can then be used to 
                    reference on a resume or a portfolio. 
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    With techie youth, the child is in charge of what they learn, so if I am interested in mobile development I can 
                    learn that, I will not be forced to learn about entreprenuering.
